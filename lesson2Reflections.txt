What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository allows git to begin tracking the repository's version history 
and allows the user to start committing changes to it. This is necessary for files that
the user would like to track and be able to review. Git does not automatically create a
repository due to storage and tracking issues, so it must be done manually.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the placeholder or cache between the working directory and the git 
repository. The staging area tells the repository which files from the working directory
to add to it. This way, if only a select portion of the working directory needs to have
version contorl, you can save space without creating more directories on your system or
server.
